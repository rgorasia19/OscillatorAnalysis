# OscillatorAnalysis

This project aims to analyse the movements of harmonic oscillators under different conditions by using numerical integration to estimate the behaviour of oscillators. It is subject to damping and forced oscillations under various conditions. The initial mass and spring constant of the oscillator can be altered to the user's preference.
